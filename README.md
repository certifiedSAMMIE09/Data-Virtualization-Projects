# Virtualization
This repository contains data virtualizations that conjure a symphony of disparate data sources, orchestrating a harmonious dance of information without the constraints of physical boundaries with the aid of seamless analytical tools.

## INTRODUCTION
At the heart of solid data virtualization prowess lies a remarkable fusion of innovation and practicality. Through the seamless interplay of technology and ingenuity, data virtualization creates a dynamic data ecosystem where boundaries blur and silos dissolve. Data, once confined, now flows effortlessly, converging from diverse sources into a harmonious symphony of insights. Data virtualization mastery not only revolutionizes access and agility but also empowers decision-makers with a holistic, real-time perspective that propels organizations into a new era of informed and nimble action.

Furthermore, in a data-driven world, the ability to efficiently integrate, manage, and analyze data is paramount. Data virtualization offers you a powerful toolkit to excel in your role, drive meaningful change, and contribute to your organization's success.

The best practice for solidifying one's skill is by immersing oneself in numerous projects, which was the major reason for these projects as a data professional, and this was achieved by using numerous features of an analytical tool called Power BI.



## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Disclaimer: The dataset provided herein is entirely fictitious and created solely for illustrative purposes. The data, attributes, and information contained within this dataset are the result of fictionalization and do not represent any actual company's operations, performance, or characteristics.

For Telecom Customer Churn Analysis: 
>Churn data for a fictional Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California, and includes details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status.

For Clife Resort Performance Analysis: 
>CLIFE Resort is the owner of several five-star hotels in Nigeria. They've been in the hospitality business for 20 years. CLIFE is losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels sector as a result of strategic actions by competitors and ineffective decision-making by management. CLIFE's managing director desired to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" as a strategic step in order to reclaim market share and income.

For Sales Analysis:
>The executives of a particular company in Nigeria have asked to analyze and provide key performance metrics that will facilitate their efforts to drive growth and enhance overall company performance. The analysis should focus on identifying actionable insights and trends across relevant areas to support informed decision-making and strategic planning.

## DATA SOURCE
